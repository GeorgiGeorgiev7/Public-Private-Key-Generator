# Generator for private-public key pairs.

## Developed as a fun project after reading "Mastering Ethereum" in order to practice ECC

### Generates:
- **Private key**: 20 characters long hexadecimal number | **20 bytes** / **256 bits** / **2^256 decimal**
- **Public key**: Presented to the user as a mnemonic phrase (24 words derived from the private key following the BIP39)

> The only dependency in the project is the keccak256 js library
